# kefis-fmcg
A simple application that tracks inventory and makes automated reorders to their off-site warehouse when the stock level hits a predefined quantity.
## Getting Started
- The application has two main parts;
  1. Client,(renders any data processed by the backend, sends requests to the backend)
  2. backend (RESTFul APIs that perform the inventory tracking operations, and expose a list of endpoints)

- To run the application, start the backend and client-side separately,
- For the backend Navigate into the backend/README.md file for instructions
- For the Client side, navigate to client/README.md for instructions on how to get started.
- The application is still in the development stages and any collaboration toward making it better is welcome
